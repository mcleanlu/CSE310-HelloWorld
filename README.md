# Overview

The Python "Hello World" program was developed with the intention of introducing Python to newcomers and showing them the fundamental capabilities of the print() function. The user may verify that the program is functioning well and that the Python environment is set up properly by running the program and seeing the result "Hello World!" shown in the console.

# Development Environment

I created the Python "Hello World" application using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my code editor. With its many capabilities for Python development, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging, VS Code is a free, open-source program. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is popular for many uses, including web development and data research. It is also simple to learn.

# Run Application

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python helloworld.py
```
